  Computer science is the study of computing and information systems. It is a discipline that emerged in the mid-20th century as a result of the need to develop methods for processing and managing large amounts of data, especially in the fields of business, science, and engineering.

The mathematical basis of computer science is rooted in a number of mathematical disciplines, including algebra, number theory, graph theory, logic, and probability theory. These mathematical tools are used to design algorithms, analyze their properties, and develop efficient methods for solving problems.

The story of computer science begins with the development of mechanical calculators in the 17th century, such as the Pascaline and the Difference Engine, which were designed to perform basic arithmetic operations. However, it was not until the development of electronic computers in the mid-20th century that computer science became a distinct discipline.

The first electronic computers were developed during World War II to solve military problems, such as code breaking and ballistics calculations. These early computers were based on vacuum tubes and were very large and expensive. However, they paved the way for the development of smaller and more affordable computers, such as the UNIVAC and the IBM 360, which were used for scientific, business, and administrative applications.

During the 1960s and 1970s, computer science began to emerge as a distinct academic discipline. The first computer science departments were established at universities, and computer scientists began to develop new programming languages, such as Fortran, Algol, and Lisp, to make programming easier and more efficient.

In the 1980s and 1990s, computer science continued to evolve, with the development of new areas of study, such as artificial intelligence, computer graphics, and computer networks. These areas of study relied heavily on mathematical tools, such as logic and probability theory, to develop algorithms and analyze their properties.

Today, computer science is a rapidly growing field with a wide range of applications, from scientific research and engineering to business and entertainment. It continues to rely heavily on mathematics to develop new algorithms and solve complex problems, and it remains a key driver of technological innovation and economic growth
